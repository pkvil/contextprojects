\chapter[domitian]{Domitian}

{\it Domitian} is a typeface based on the {\it Palatino} design by Hermann Zapf, as implemented in the {\it URW Palladio L} typeface, but extended to cover more glyphs.

Palatino is a humanist typeface inspired by italian renaissance calligraphy, with larger proportions than for example {\it Garamond} or {\it Bembo}. The reason for this was at least in part due to the poor quality of paper available at the time in Germany.

To get an average of 66 characters per line, use a line lenth of 110 mm for a 10 pt body font, 118 mm for an 11 pt body font, and 131 mm for a 12 pt body font.

{\it Pagella} provides fonts in regular, {\it italic}, {\bf bold}, and {\bi bold italic} with \hairspace{\spaceskip 0.28em\kerncharacters[0.08]\sc small caps} \hairspace in the regular style, old-style figures (0123456789) and lining figures ({\feature[+][lnum]01234567890}). There is support for Roman, Greek, and Cyrillic alphabets.
