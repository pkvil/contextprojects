\question[ownnumber={11.1}, title={Briefly explain how gravity affects blood pressure.}] 

\vskip-0.5\baselineskip\relax

Blood is assisted back to the heart from the lower extremities, and this causes blood pressure to be the greatest in the head and the lowest in the feet.

\question[ownnumber={11.2}, title={Briefly describe how inverted postures might serve to lower one's blood pressure, and how they might serve to elevate one's blood pressure.}] 

\vskip-0.5\baselineskip
On the one hand, blood pressure will immediately increase in the head and upper body. However, on balance, inversions will decrease overall blood pressure through reflex hypo\-tension.
