\item Lower down onto your forearms, keeping the elbows beneath the shoulders
\item Interlace the fingers
\item \color[inhale]{Inhale}: Allow your forearms to bear more of your body weight as you tip-toe the feet closer to the shoulders. Eventually stack your hips above your shoulders. 
\item \color[exhale]{Exhale}: Lower the crown of your head on to the mat between the forearms.
\item Pause for a couple breaths in Dolphin Pose  
\item \color[inhale]{Inhale}: Press through the shoulders and fold the knees in towards your abdomen
\item Feel that the weight pours into your forearms more than your head
\item \color[exhale]{Exhale}: Uncurl the legs and extend them up towards the ceiling, pointing your toes (plantar flexion)
\item Maintain your breath and picture the spine mimicking that of a Tadasana spine.
\item Have your focal point directly in front of you to assist with balance

\item Allow the toes to touch back to your mat
\item \color[inhale]{Inhale}: Release the head
\item \color[exhale]{Exhale}: Send the seat back towards your heels for a yummy Child's Pose
