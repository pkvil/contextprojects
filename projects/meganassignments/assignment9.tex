\question[ownnumber={9.2},title={Briefly describe what the diaphragm does during inhalation and exhalation.}]

During inhalation, the diaphragm contracts and flattens while it moves downwards and presses against the abdominal organs. Therefore, there is more space inside the thoracic cavity. Duing exhalation, the diaphragm relaxes into its mushroom/parachute shape and rises upwards.
